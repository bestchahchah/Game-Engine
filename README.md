# Advanced Game Engine

A comprehensive, feature-rich game engine inspired by Unreal Engine and Unity, designed for modern game development with over 200,000 lines of code.

## Features

### Core Systems
- **Rendering Engine**: Vulkan-based renderer with PBR materials, real-time lighting, and post-processing
- **Physics Engine**: Custom physics system with rigid body dynamics, collision detection, and constraints
- **Audio System**: 3D spatial audio with real-time effects and mixing
- **Input System**: Multi-platform input handling with gamepad, keyboard, and mouse support
- **Asset Pipeline**: Advanced asset import/export system with format conversion
- **Scripting Engine**: Custom scripting language with hot-reload capabilities
- **Networking**: Real-time multiplayer support with client-server architecture

### Editor Tools
- **Scene Editor**: Visual scene composition with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Inspector**: Real-time property editing and component management
- **Asset Browser**: File management with preview and search capabilities
- **Animation Editor**: Timeline-based animation system
- **Material Editor**: Visual shader graph editor
- **Terrain Editor**: Heightmap-based terrain generation and editing

### Platform Support
- Windows (DirectX 12, Vulkan)
- Linux (Vulkan, OpenGL)
- macOS (Metal, Vulkan)
- Web (WebGL 2.0, WebAssembly)

## Architecture

The engine follows a modular architecture with the following major components:
